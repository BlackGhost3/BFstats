# BFstats
Simple desktop GUI app to show battlefield player stats.

you'll need a API Key to get players data, get your own from [here](https://battlefieldtracker.com/site-api)

add your API key to [api.js](/BFstats/blob/master/app/resources/js/api.js)

first of all i'm new to github this is my first project on it
and this is first software i've published
if there is anything wrong in the code or the way I uploaded the file please let me know.

i'm using [battlefield-stats](https://github.com/MattMcFarland/battlefield-stats) API to get players data.

suggestion and new ideas are welcomed.

i'll try to make windows installer for it ASAP.
